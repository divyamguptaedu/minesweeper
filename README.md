# minesweeper
Command line ASCII based Minesweeper game. Developed in Python.


I grew up playing the traditional Microsoft version of the Minesweeper game; alas, the MacBook does not come with this game pre-installed, so I decided to program my own. The gameplay is really simple — First, you select a difficulty level; then you select a cell by inputting its position and lastly you decide whether to put a flag at the cell in interest. This manual assumes that the reader is familiar with the minesweeper rules, if not click this.

In order to enjoy this game, direct to the folder with the minesweeper.py script using command line. And then you fire up the game by typing the following command — 
				
				python minesweeper.py
